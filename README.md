React.js, a popular library for frontend development, offers benefits like code reusability and faster page loads.

I have Build a weather dashboard that provides current weather information and forecasts for 
different cities. The application allow users to search for cities and display the 
current weather and a 7-day forecast. 

I have created a rect project using command npm create vite@latest.
 
During this project, I utilized React.js concepts such as JSX, props, hooks (useState and useEffect), and events.
I also used Material UI, an open-source library, for prebuilt components and design elements.
To fetch and display weather information, I integrated the OpenWeather API.

Through this project, I have enhanced my proficiency in React.js, JavaScript, and frontend development.
